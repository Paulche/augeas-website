The files for the Augeas website.

You need python-docutils since all the content is in restructured text[1]

You also need rest2web[2], that is used as the template engine.  This can be
untarred anywhere and the r2w.py script linked into PATH as `r2w`.

The website is stored in two branches:
  * master contains the source files read by rest2web
  * gh-pages contains the generated r2w output, which is published via GitHub
    pages

To publish, run `make` to generate the website under build/.  Switch branches
to gh-pages and copy the contents of build/html/ to the root of the repo.
Commit the changes on both branches.  A `make sync` target is also available to
automate this process.

When the gh-pages branch is pushed to GitHub, the public-facing website will
update immediately.
