Todo list
===============

If you are interested in helping out, there are some general things that
always need attention:

* Write descriptors for more files. Eventually, Augeas should cover *all*
  commonly used configuration files
* Convince upstream projects to ship their own Augeas lenses. Currently, we
  ship a lot of lenses as part of Augeas, but they should really be shipped
  and maintained by the same people whose config files the lens
  processes. All that upstream needs to do is ship one text file, and keep
  that up to date whenever they change their config file format.
* Better documentation. Of anything. We need more reference docs, howtos,
  tips & tricks on usage etc.

Specific todo items, i.e. things that are clear enough that they can be
implemented, are kept as `tickets in the bugtracker`_.

If you want to work on any of those items, please get in touch first, to
avoid duplicate work. If you want to add to the list of todo items, file a
new ticket with milestone 'wishlist'.
