Todo list
===============

In no particular order, these are the things that need to be addressed,
hopefully soon; patches enthusiastically appreciated:

* Write descriptors for more files. Eventually, Augeas should cover *all*
  commonly used configuration files
* Processing of ``httpd.conf``. It's notjust a big file with lots of
  different directives, it can also not be described by a regular language,
  since it allows nesting things lie ``<IfModule ...> ... </IfModule``
  arbitrarily deep.
* Support case-insensitive matching of regular expressions, either with a
  new builtin function of type regexp->regexp, or by expanding the regexp
  literal syntax to allow /[a-z]/i, i.e. add flags at the end of the regexp
  (or both)
* Bring the code to production quality. Particularly allocation failures
  need to be carefully looked at.
* Named character classes in regular expressions. Other differences to
  extended POSIX regexps are probably not worth addressing (collating
  sequences) or are impossible to address with true regular expressions
  (back references)
* Use ustr_ for strings instead of naked C strings
* Expand the XPath like language:

  - Add an operator for "match any number of children", either using ``//``
    like XPath or ``**`` as some file utilities like ``rsync`` do
  - Allow simple arithmetic expressions in path indices; in particular
    allow ``label[last()-N]`` to address the N-th last node called
    ``label``.
  - More adventurous query syntax like
    ``/files/etc/inittab/*/runlevels[../action="initdefault"]`` to select the
    runlevels part of the line in inittab that sets the default runlevel.
