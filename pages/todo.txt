Todo list
===============

In now particular order, these are the things that need to be addressed,
hopefully soon; patches enthusiastically appreciated: 

* Write descriptors for more files. Eventually, Augeas should cover *all*
  commonly used configuration files
* Reasonable runtime error reporting. Since Augeas is meant to be used as a
  library, spewing errors on the console is useless. Errors encountered
  during parsing are already reported underneath ``/augeas/files``. Many
  other errors, e.g. when the tree was modified in such a way that writing
  it to disk would result in a syntactically incorrect file, need to be
  reported in a similar way.
* Bring the code to production quality. Particularly memory management is a
  sore area, and the current code more than likely leaks like a sieve.
* Make Augeas buildable on more platforms. It has been built on Fedora and
  RHEL, but I have no idea how hard it is to build Augeas on other
  platforms. Given a POSIX C library, the changes needed should be slight.
* Named character classes in regular expressions. Other differences to
  extended POSIX regexps are probably not worth addressing (collating
  sequences) or are impossible to address with true regular expressions
  (back references)
* Use ustr_ for strings instead of naked C strings
* Expand the XPath like language:

  - Add an operator for "match any number of children", either using ``//``
    like XPath or ``**`` as some file utilities like ``rsync`` do
  - Allow simple arithmetic expressions in path indices; in particular
    allow ``label[last()-N]`` to address the N-th last node called
    ``label``.
