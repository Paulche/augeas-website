==================================
Augeas - a Linux configuration API
==================================

Augeas is a configuration editing tool. It parses configuration files in
their native formats and transforms them into a tree. Configuration changes
are made by manipulating this tree and saving them back into native config
files.

Augeas is:
==========

* A Linux configuration API provided by a C library
* A command line tool to manipulate configuration from the shell (and shell
  scripts)
* Language bindings to do the same from your favoirte scripting language

Augeas goals:
=============

* Manipulate configuration files safely, safer than the ad-hoc techniques
  generally used with grep, sed, awk and similar mechanisms in scripting
  languages 
* Provide a local configuration API for Linux 
* Make it easy to integrate new config files into the Augeas tree

The code is an early prototype. Instructions on how to explore the current
implementation can be found on the `introductory tour`_.
