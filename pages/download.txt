Augeas can be downloaded in one of the following ways:

* RPM's for Fedora/RHEL can be found in `my yum repo`_
* The latest released tarball is on the `download page`_
* Check out Augeas from source from the `mercurial repository`_ (see
  developers_ for instructions)

No matter what you do, remember that Augeas is **prototype** code and will
most likely **eat** members of your **immediate family** (and not
necessarily the ones you thought had it coming)
