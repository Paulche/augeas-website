====================
Releases
====================

0.2.0 - 2008-06-05
-------------------
- Augeas is now much more portable

  * Pull in gnulib on non-glibc systems
  * Augeas now builds and runs on FreeBSD (possibly others, too)

- Various fixes for memory corruption and the like (Jim Meyering, James Antill)
- New lenses

  * vsftpd.conf
  * various bugfixes in existing lenses

0.1.1 - 2008-05-16
--------------------

- Add subtraction of regexps to the language, for example ``let re =
  /[a-z]+/ - /(Allow|Deny)Users/`` is now legal
- Report errors during get/put in the tree; added subnodes to
  ``/augeas/files/PATH/error`` for that purpose
- Many many bugfixes:

  - plugged all known memory leaks
  - fixed typecheck for lens union (l1 | l2) which was plain wrong
  - reduce overall memory usage by releasing unused compiled regexps
  - further performance improvements in libfa
  - check that values match the regexps in STORE when saving

- libfa can now convert an automaton back to a regular expression
  (FA_AS_REGEXP)
- New lenses for ``/etc/fstab``, ``/etc/xinetd.conf`` and ``/etc/xinetd.d/*``


0.1.0 - 2008-05-01
--------------------

- Various changes to public API:

  * Remove aug_exists from public API, and merge functionality into aug_get
  * Do not hide pointer behind typedef; instead Augeas 'handle' type is now
    struct augeas, typedef'd to augeas (Jim Meyering)
  * Const-correctness of public API, return error indication
    from aug_print (Jim Meyering)
  * Make buildable on Debian Etch (remove -fstack-protector from compiler
    switches)

- Public API is now stable, and existing calls will be supported without
  further changes
- New schema:

  * /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* (Alan Pevec)
  * Assorted other files from /etc/sysconfig (the ones that just set
    shell variables)
  * /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* (Dean Wilson)

- Man page for augtool (Dean Wilson)

0.0.8 - 2008-04-16
--------------------

- Complete rewrite of the language for schema descriptions

0.0.7 - 2008-03-14
--------------------

- Typecheck lenses; in particular, discover and complain about ambiguous
  concatenation and iteration
- Enable typechecking for augparse by default, and for augtool via the
  '-c' flag
- Fixed lens definitions in spec/ to pass typechecking. They contained
  quite a few stupid and subtle problems
- Greatly improved libfa performance to make typechecking reasonably
  fast. Typechecking cmfm.aug went from more than two hours to under two
  seconds

0.0.6 - 2008-03-05
--------------------

- Make it possible to overwrite files when saving with and without
  backups
- Take the filesystem root as an optional argument to aug_init
- Expose these two things as command line options in augtool


0.0.5 - 2008-03-05
--------------------

- Changed public API to contain explicit reference to augeas_t
  structure. This makes it easier to write threadsafe code using Augeas
- Added libfa, finite automata library, though it's not yet used by
  Augeas

0.0.4 - 2008-02-25
--------------------

- package as RPM and make sure Augeas can be build on Fedora/RHEL

0.0.3 - 2008-02-25
--------------------

- further rework; file processing now resembles Boomerang lenses much
  more closely
- major revamp of the internal tree representation (ordered tree where
  multiple children can have the same label, including NULL labels)
- move away from LL(1) parsing in favor of regular languages, since they
  enable much better ahead-of-time checks (which are not implemented yet)

0.0.2 - 2008-01-29:
--------------------

- completely reworked
- processing of files is now based on a textual description of the
  structure of the files (basically a LL(1) grammar)

0.0.1 - 2007-12-01:
--------------------

- First release.
- Public API and basic tree data structure.
- Record scanning works.
- Providers for pam.d, inittab and /etc/hosts
- Simple tests and test driver
