====================
Releases
====================

0.4.2 - 2009-03-09
------------------
- Do not delete files that had an error upon parsing
- For Fedora/EPEL RPM's, BuildRequire libselinux-devel (bug #26)
- In path expressions, the meaning of '<' and '<=' was reversed
- Always create an entry /files in aug_init
- New builtin 'Sys' module with functions 'getenv' and 'read_file',
  the latter reads a the contents of a file into a string
- Lens changes/additions

  * Postfix_main: handle continuation lines
  * Bbhosts, Hosts, Logrotate, Sudoers: label comment nodes as '#comment'
  * Sshd: map comments as '#comment' nodes
  * Squid: add all keywords from squid 2.7 and 3 (Francois Deppierraz)
  * Logrotate: process unit suffixes for 'size' and 'minsize'

0.4.1 - 2009-03-02
------------------
- Remove files when their entire subtree under /files is deleted
- Various bug fixes and syntax enhancements for path expressions
  (see tests/xpath.tests for details)
- Evaluate path expressions with multiple predicates correctly
- Fix incorrect setting of /augeas/events/saved
- Major cleanup of matching during get; drastically improves
  performance for very large (on the order of 10k lines) config files
- Small performance improvement in the typechecker
- Reject invalid character sets like [x-u] during typecheck
- Build with compile warnings set to 'maximum' instead of 'error', so
  that builds on platforms with broken headers will work out of the box
- Lens changes/additions

  * Util.stdexcl now excludes .augsave and .augnew files
  * Logrotate: allow 'yearly' schedule, spaces around braces
  * Ntp: fix so that it processes ntp.conf on Fedora 10
  * Services: lens for /etc/services (Raphael Pinson)
  * Xorg: new lens and tests (Raphael Pinson)

0.4.0 - 2009-02-06
------------------
- Much improved and expanded support for path expressions in the public
  API. See doc/xpath.txt and tests/xpath.tests for details.
- Solaris support: builds at least on OpenSolaris 2008.11
- Lens changes/additions

  * Grub: support color and savedefault
  * DarkIce: new lens for http://darkice.tyrell.hu/ (Free Ekanayaka)

0.3.6 - 2009-01-26
------------------
- report version in /augeas/version, report legal save modes in
  /augeas/version/save/mode for feature tests/version checking
- dynamically change behavior of aug_save; add noop save mode
  (Bryan Kearney)
- plug memory leak, more portable SELinux test (Jim Meyering)
- fix bz #478619 - do not use abspath (Arnaud Gomes-do-Vale)
- fix segfault when branch in a union does not have a ktype
- Lens changes/additions

  * Dpkg: new lens for Debian's dpkg.cfg (Robin Lee Powell)
  * Limits: new lens for /etc/security/limits.conf (Free Ekanayaka)

    expand filter for Php config files (Robin Lee Powell)
  * Phpvars: whitspace fixes (Free Ekanayaka)
  * Puppet: accept indented puppet.conf (ticket #25)

0.3.5 - 2008-12-23
------------------
- add an option to rewrite files by overwriting their contents instead of
  putting the new file in place atomically with rename(2); file contents
  are only copied after rename fails with EXDEV or EBUSY, and only if the
  node `/augeas/save/copy_if_rename_fails` (fix #32)
- saving of backup (`.augsave`) files now works even if the original and
  backup files are on different devices
- major refactoring of how path expressions are handled internally. Fixes
  a number of bugs and oddities (e.g. tickets #7 and #23)
- fix a bug in `fa_as_regexp`: a '.' wasn't escaped, ultimately leading to
  spurious errors from the typechecker
- Lens changes/additions

  * Group: process /etc/group (Free Ekanayaka)
  * Passwd: process /etc/passwd (Free Ekanayaka)
  * Phpvars: process files that set PHP variables, in particular
    /etc/squirrelmail/config.php (Free Ekanayaka)
  * Rsyncd: process /etc/rsyncd.conf (Marc Fournier)
  * Shellvars: process /etc/arno-iptables-firewall/debconf.cfg and
    /etc/cron-apt/config (Free Ekanayaka), load /etc/sysconfig/sendmail
  * Postfix: process postfix's main.cf and master.cf (Free Ekanayaka)
  * Squid: new lens for squid.conf (Free Ekanayaka)
  * Webmin: new lens (Free Ekanayaka)
  * Xinetd: make sure equal sign is surrounded by spaces (#30)
  * Sshd: change the structure of Condition subtrees (Dominique Dumont)

0.3.4 - 2008-11-05
------------------
- fix saving of backup files; in 0.3.3, when AUG_SAVE_BACKUP was passed
  to aug_init, aug_save would always fail

0.3.3 - 2008-10-24
------------------
- restore the behavior of aug_save; in 0.3.2, aug_save broke API by
  returning the number of files changed on success instead of 0

0.3.2 - 2008-10-21
------------------

- `aug_save` now reports which files were actually changed in
  `/augeas/events/saved`; it also returns the number of files
  that were changed
- preserve file owner, permissions and SELinux context when changing a file.
- make saving idempotent, i.e. when a change to the tree does not result
  in changes to the actual file's content, do not touch the original file
- report an error if there are nodes in the tree with a label that
  is not allowed by the lens
- quietly append a newline to files that do not have one
- generate lens documentation using NaturalDocs and publish those
  on the Auegas website (Raphael Pinson)
- Lens changes/additions

  * Grub: support the 'password' directive (Joel Nimety)
  * Grub: support 'serial' and 'terminal' directives (Sean E. Millichamp)
  * Samba: change default indentation and separators (Free Ekanayaka)
  * Logrotate: process tabooext, add dateext flag (Sean E. Millichamp)
  * Sshd: Cleaner handling of 'Match' blocks (Dominique Dumont)
  * Monit: new lens (Free Ekanayaka)
  * Ldap: merge with Spacevars (Free Ekanayaka)
  * Shellvars: support /etc/default (Free Ekanayaka)
  * Shellvars: handle space at the end of a line

0.3.1 - 2008-09-04
------------------

- Major performance improvement when processing huge files, reducing some
  O(n^2) behavior to O(n) behavior. It's now entirely feasible to
  manipulate for example `/etc/hosts` files with 65k lines
- Handle character escapes in regular expressions in compliance with
  Posix ERE
- `aug_mv`: fix bug when moving at the root level
- Fix endless loop when using a mixed-case module name like MyMod.lns
- Typecheck del lens: for `del RE STR`, STR must match RE
- Properly typecheck the '?' operator, especially the atype; also allow
  '?' to be applied to lenses that contain only 'store', and do not
  produce tree nodes.

--------------------

- Add subtraction of regexps to the language, for example ``let re =
  /[a-z]+/ - /(Allow|Deny)Users/`` is now legal
- Report errors during get/put in the tree; added subnodes to
  ``/augeas/files/PATH/error`` for that purpose
- Many many bugfixes:

  - plugged all known memory leaks
  - fixed typecheck for lens union (l1 | l2) which was plain wrong
  - reduce overall memory usage by releasing unused compiled regexps
  - further performance improvements in libfa
  - check that values match the regexps in STORE when saving

0.1.0 - 2008-05-01
--------------------

- Various changes to public API:

  * Remove aug_exists from public API, and merge functionality into aug_get
  * Do not hide pointer behind typedef; instead Augeas 'handle' type is now
    struct augeas, typedef'd to augeas (Jim Meyering)
  * Const-correctness of public API, return error indication
    from aug_print (Jim Meyering)
  * Make buildable on Debian Etch (remove -fstack-protector from compiler
    switches)

- Public API is now stable, and existing calls will be supported without
  further changes
- New schema:

  * /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* (Alan Pevec)
  * Assorted other files from /etc/sysconfig (the ones that just set
    shell variables)

0.0.8 - 2008-04-16
--------------------

- Complete rewrite of the language for schema descriptions

0.0.7 - 2008-03-14
--------------------

- Typecheck lenses; in particular, discover and complain about ambiguous
  concatenation and iteration
- Enable typechecking for augparse by default, and for augtool via the
  '-c' flag
- Fixed lens definitions in spec/ to pass typechecking. They contained
  quite a few stupid and subtle problems
- Greatly improved libfa performance to make typechecking reasonably
  fast. Typechecking cmfm.aug went from more than two hours to under two
  seconds

0.0.6 - 2008-03-05
--------------------

- Make it possible to overwrite files when saving with and without
  backups
- Take the filesystem root as an optional argument to aug_init
- Expose these two things as command line options in augtool


0.0.5 - 2008-03-05
--------------------

- Changed public API to contain explicit reference to augeas_t
  structure. This makes it easier to write threadsafe code using Augeas
- Added libfa, finite automata library, though it's not yet used by
  Augeas

0.0.4 - 2008-02-25
--------------------

- package as RPM and make sure Augeas can be build on Fedora/RHEL

0.0.3 - 2008-02-25
--------------------

- further rework; file processing now resembles Boomerang lenses much
  more closely
- major revamp of the internal tree representation (ordered tree where
  multiple children can have the same label, including NULL labels)
- move away from LL(1) parsing in favor of regular languages, since they
  enable much better ahead-of-time checks (which are not implemented yet)

0.0.2 - 2008-01-29:
--------------------

- completely reworked
- processing of files is now based on a textual description of the
  structure of the files (basically a LL(1) grammar)

0.0.1 - 2007-12-01:
--------------------

- First release.
- Public API and basic tree data structure.
- Record scanning works.
- Providers for pam.d, inittab and /etc/hosts
- Simple tests and test driver
