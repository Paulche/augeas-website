How can I help ?
----------------

One easy way to help is to write a description for your favorite config
file; you don't need to be a developer to do that. 

If you want to roll up your sleeves and hack, the Todo_ list has some items
that desparately need somebody to look at. Particularly, writing language
bindings and getting Augeas to build on a wide variety of platforms do
not require a lot of knowledge of Augeas internals, and might be an ideal
way to cut your teeth.
