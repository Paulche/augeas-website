Where is the mailing list ?
---------------------------

The mailing list is ``augeas-devel@redhat.com``. Subscribe by going to `the
list page`_.

The list is for any discussion around Augeas, be it bug reports, feature
requests, trouble writing file format descriptions etc.

How can I help ?
----------------

One easy way to help is to write a description for your favorite config
file; you don't need to be a developer to do that. 

If you want to roll up your sleeves and hack, the Todo_ list has some items
that desparately need somebody to look at. Particularly, writing language
bindings and getting Augeas to build on a wide variety of platforms do
not require a lot of knowledge of Augeas internals, and might be an ideal
way to cut your teeth.

Where is the source ?
---------------------

Sources are in a `mercurial repository`_. To check out the code, run

::

  hg clone http://hg.et.redhat.com/misc/augeas

To build and explore, you need to:

::

  cd augeas
  ./autogen.sh && make
  # Start a session with augtool that reads lens descriptions from ./spec
  # and runs with AUGEAS_ROOT=./build/try, populated from ./tests/root/
  ./src/try cli

Besides autotools_, you will need to have ``readline-devel``, Bison_ and
Flex_ installed to build Augeas successfully.

What language bindings are available ?
--------------------------------------

Ruby bindings have been contributed by Bryan Kearney and can be found in a
`separate mercurial repository`_. To check them out, run

::

  hg clone http://hg.et.redhat.com/misc/ruby-augeas

To build them, you need ``rake``. Simply run ``rake build`` to compile
them.
