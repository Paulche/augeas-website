How can I help ?
----------------

One easy way to help is to `write a description`_ for your favorite config
file; you don't need to be a developer to do that. 

If you want to roll up your sleeves and hack, the Todo_ list has some items
that desparately need somebody to look at. Particularly, getting Augeas to
build on a wide variety of platforms and packaging it for them do not
require a lot of knowledge of Augeas internals. Since Augeas is a fairly
low-level service, patching your favorite config management
tool/script/application to use it is also a great way to help.

Where is the mailing list ?
---------------------------

The mailing list is ``augeas-devel@redhat.com``. Subscribe by going to `the
list page`_.

The list is for any discussion around Augeas, be it bug reports, feature
requests, trouble writing file format descriptions etc.

Where is the IRC channel ?
--------------------------

The best place to find somebody connected to Augeas on IRC is ``#augeas``
on Freenode_. Use the following settings in your IRC client:

* Server: ``chat.freenode.net``
* Port: ``6667`` (the default IRC port)
* Channel: ``#augeas``

Where is the source ?
---------------------

Sources are in a `mercurial repository`_. To check out the code, run

::

  hg clone http://hg.et.redhat.com/misc/augeas

To build and explore, you need to:

::

  cd augeas
  ./autogen.sh && make
  # Start a session with augtool that reads lens descriptions from ./lenses
  # and runs with AUGEAS_ROOT=./build/try, populated from ./tests/root/
  ./src/try cli

Besides autotools_ (in particular, ``autoconf``, ``automake``, and
``libtool``), you will need to have ``readline-devel``, Bison_ and Flex_
installed to build Augeas successfully.

What language bindings are available ?
--------------------------------------

Ruby
++++

Ruby bindings have been contributed by Bryan Kearney and can be found in a
`separate mercurial repository`_. To check them out, run

::

  hg clone http://hg.et.redhat.com/misc/ruby-augeas

To build them, you need ``rake``. Simply run ``rake build`` to compile
them.

Python
++++++

Python bindings have been contributed by Harald Hoyer and can be found in
`their own mercurial repository`_. To check them out, run

::

  hg clone http://hg.et.redhat.com/misc/python-augeas
