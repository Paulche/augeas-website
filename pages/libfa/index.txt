===============
Finite Automata
===============

For Augeas, I needed a library to perform certain operations on regular
languages, not just regular expressions. For example, Augeas needs to
decide if two regular languages have words in common. Computations like
these require working with finite automata, one of the theoretical
underpinnings of regular expressions. 

Sadly, there does not seem to be a well-maintained open source C library
out there. That forced me to write my own. Luckily, there is a very good
automata library written in Java: `dk.brics.automaton`_. ``libfa`` is
largely a reimplementation in C.

Getting ``libfa``
-----------------

To save others from the pain I had to go through, ``libfa`` is built into a
separate DSO when you build Augeas. To download it, `download and install
Augeas`_. It's not distributed separately, but if there's interest, I am
more than happy to make that so.

When you install Augeas, ``libfa`` is installed as ``libfa.so``, and the
header file ``fa.h`` is put into ``/usr/include``.

Sources
-------

The source for ``libfa`` is in the files ``src/fa.[ch]`` in the Augeas
sources. See `Operations`_ or ``fa.h`` for details on the operations
supported by ``libfa``.

License
-------

Just like Augeas, ``libfa`` is licensed under the LGPL, version 2 or
later.

Contact
-------

If you find ``libfa`` useful, or have any comments/feature requests for it,
or even better, patches, feel free to contact me_ directly or post
something on the `Augeas mailing list`_.
