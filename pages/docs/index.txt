There are two very different things one might want to do with Augeas:

1. use its public API and existing file format descriptions to edit config
   files

2. write new file format descriptions

Using the Augeas API
--------------------
If you are mainly interested in Augeas' public API, the best documentation
right now is the public header file ``augeas.h`` and ``augtool``'s
``help`` command. The commands in ``augtool`` mirror the public API
closely, and therefore give you an easy way to tinker with it without
writing any code.

* `Public API`_
* `Tree Representation and Path Expressions`_

Writing schemas
---------------

If you are mainly interested in describing new file formats, you should
read about `lenses`_, the basic building blocks of the transformation
between files and the tree, and the tutorial on `writing schemas`_.

* Lenses_
* `Writing Schemas`_
* `Language Overview`_

Reference documentation
-----------------------

* `Existing lenses <references/lenses/index.html>`__
* `C API <references/c_api/index.html>`__
* `Ruby API documentation <ruby/api/index.html>`__
