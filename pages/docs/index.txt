There are two very different things one might want to do with Augeas:

1. use its public API and existing file format descriptions to edit config
   files

2. write new file format descriptions

Using the Augeas API
--------------------
If you are mainly interested in Augeas' public API, the best documentation
right now is the public header file ``augeas.h`` and ``augtool``'s
``help`` command. The commands in ``augtool`` mirror the public API
closely, and therefore give you an easy way to tinker with it without
writing any code.

Writing file format descriptions
--------------------------------

If you are mainly interested in describing new file formats, you should
read about Augeas' `internal tree representation`_ and about `lenses`_, the
basic building blocks of the transformation between files and the tree.

.. _lenses: lenses.html
